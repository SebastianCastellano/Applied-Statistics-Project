For each subject (math, science, read) there are three plots.
The logic is the same for each subject so we will use math for example.
1) Math ranking - All studs, contains the countries' ranking based on the
   mean score in math obtained by considering all students of the relative country
2) Math ranking - Immig studs, contains the countries' ranking based on the 
   mean score in math obtained by considering all immig students (1st gen and 2nd gen) of the relative country
3) Math ranking - all studs - After ANOVA, aggregates the countries for which an anova doesn't reject the
   null hypothesis of them having the same mean. The mean plotted is the math mean of the aggregated countries.
