Plot obtained from two_way_manova_of_math_scie_read_wrt_countries_immig.R
It shows the ranking of the countries base on the difference between mean of native students in a subject
minus mean of the 2nd gen immig students in the same subject.
The smaller the difference the better.

Moreover, we must check if the difference is significant, by running an anova of the groups.
We do so in anova_of_math_scie_read_wrt_native_1stgen_2ndgen.R
The only not significant difference is GBR in math and reading.

Below you can find all significant differences:
