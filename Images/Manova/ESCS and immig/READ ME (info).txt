To assess if immigration effects on math/read scores are just masking
the true reason which may be being poorer we perfrom a two way anova of
ESCS_status (proxy of richness level) and immig.

By observing that the interaction effect is not null we reject the hypothesis
(great, fiuf).

Moreover we can rank the quartiles of ESCS in which there are more differences
in native/immig.
Being richer (4th quartile) is better since there are the less differences.
